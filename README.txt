-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO PLAY

1. Run the "PekomonRunner.java" file in the "Pekomon" folder
2: Select your Pekomon
3: Battle 
    -You can use a light attack, heavy attack, special move (For evolution 1 and above), and ultimate move (Evolution 2)
    -Heavy, special, and ultimate attacks have limited charges
    -You can also heal using health potions
    -If necessary, you can always flee a battle; chance of success depends on the difference in speed between Pekomon
4: Collect rewards after battle
    -Rewards range from health potions, stat upgrades, XP boosts, immediate heals, ability charges, and even selecting a new Pekomon
    -If the previous battle was fleed from, reward options are limited to one instead of the regular three :/
5: Repeat until you level up
    -Leveling up brings your Pekomon to a new evolution with new abilities. Be sure to check these out in "Your Pekomon."
6: Catch em' all! (Defeat as many opponents as possible in the name of sweet victory)
